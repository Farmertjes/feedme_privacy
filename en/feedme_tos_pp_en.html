<h1>Feed Me</h1>

<p>Feed Me is a simple application that allows you and some of the people you trust (with your password) to keep track of when and how much you have fed your baby.</p>

<p>Below we outline our Terms of Services and our Privacy Policy. The Terms of Services are an agreement between you – the user – and us – the creators of Feed Me, Noodlewerk Apps –.</p>

<p>If you want to contact us, you can reach us anytime at the following address;</p>

<p>Noodlewerk Apps<br />
Binckhorstlaan 36<br />
2516 BE The Hague<br />
The Netherlands</p>

<p>We&#8217;d love a postcard :)</p>

<p>You can also call us at <a href="tel://0031703697057">+31 70 369 70 57</a> or email us at <a href="mailto://feedme@noodlewerk.com">feedme@noodlewerk.com</a> or visit our website at <a href="https://noodlewerk.com">noodlewerk.com</a>.</p>

<h2>Terms of Services</h2>

<p>While the app is completely functional if you use it without an account, you can create an account when you want to use multiple devices (and probably people) to track feeding the same baby with Feed Me. That&#8217;s where these Terms of Services come into play. </p>

<h3>1. Acceptance and Modification</h3>

<ol>
<li>By creating a Feed Me account, you agree to these Terms of Services.</li>
<li>We reserve the right to change these terms. The new terms will be available on in the app.</li>
<li>We will notify you per email when we change these Terms of Services significantly. This applies to anything beyond simple clarifications or typo fixes.</li>
</ol>

<h3>2. Age restrictions</h3>

<ol>
<li>You promise to be at least 13 years of age when you create an account. Also, get your parent&#8217;s consent before creating an account if you&#8217;re younger than 18 years.</li>
</ol>

<h3>3. Access to Feed Me</h3>

<ol>
<li>To access your data in Feed Me, you log in with your email address and your password.

<ol>
<li>You acknowledge that you use an email and password that you&#8217;re comfortable sharing with people you trust, or that you keep it to yourself altogether.</li>
<li>Make sure it&#8217;s a password you haven&#8217;t used anywhere else.</li>
<li>We will never share your email or password with other parties.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>We don&#8217;t promise that Feed Me will exist forever. This means that you might lose access to your account and your account&#8217;s data.

<ol>
<li>You will not hold us responsible for the loss of your data.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<h3>4. We are not medical experts</h3>

<ol>
<li>We offer a simple amount suggestion for the amount of feed your kid needs daily.

<ol>
<li>This calculation is based of a <a href="https://www.centrumjeugdengezin.nl/baby/gezondheid-en-voeding/flesvoeding/hoeveel-flesvoeding">dutch website, Centrum voor Jeugd en Gezin</a>, that informs people on how much their baby needs to eat daily.</li>
<li>This suggestion is just that, a suggestion. This is not medical advice in any way or form.</li>
<li>If you want to be really sure, ask your own doctor.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<h3>5. Liability</h3>

<ol>
<li>You will not hold us liable for the loss of any of your account&#8217;s data.</li>
<li>You will not hold us liable for any losses or damages that may occur by using Feed Me.</li>
<li>If you plan on holding us liable anyway, we direct your to the courts in The Hague, Netherlands. Please hold your lawsuits there.</li>
</ol>

<h3>6. Contact</h3>

<p>If you have any questions, don&#8217;t hesitate to contact us. You can find our contact information at the top of this document.</p>

<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>Since we collect some personal information, we also need to inform you about what we collect and how we intend to use it. </p>

<ol>
<li>For your account, we collect your email address and your password.

<ol>
<li>We make your password unrecognizable. We won&#8217;t actually know what it is.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>To keep track of when and how much you feed your baby, you send us the <em>time</em>, <em>amount</em> and <em>what type of feed</em> you have given your baby. We store this as well.</li>
<li>We currently use <a href="https://www.parse.com">Parse.com</a> as our cloud component. They know the above data as well.

<ol>
<li>Parse.com has <a href="http://blog.parse.com/announcements/moving-on/">announced the termination of their service</a>. This will happen next year, and we&#8217;re looking into migrating to another cloud component soon.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>We don&#8217;t plan on using your data at all. It&#8217;s just there so you can share your data across devices (and people).</li>
<li>If we change this policy significantly, we will inform you per email.</li>
</ol>
